# Typing-Speed-Game-in-C-
A typing speed game where words move from right to left across the screen. The player must type each word before it reaches the left side, losing a life if the word escapes. Players earn points for each correctly typed word, and the game continues until all lives are lost. The game allows adjusting the speed and length of the words, and players can pause, save, and resume the game at any time.

Features:
  - Right-to-Left Word Movement: Words move from left to right, and players must type them before they disappear.

  - Adjustable Speed and Word Length: Customize the speed and length of the words for varying difficulty.

  - Score and Lives: Earn points for each correct word, and lose a life if you miss one.

  - Save/Load: Option to save progress and resume later.

  - SFML for Graphics: Uses SFML for rendering and handling user input.
